# CBCT_lowdose_enhancement
- This repository is about enhancement of CBCT based lowdose CT image
- We developed lowdose protocol of our CBCT using binning mode and mA modulation
- As a result, the quality lowdose images were extremely dergaded 
- Therefore we are proposing deep learning based lowdose CBCT image enhancement method



## Dataset
- Normally the lowdose protocol not have been used in real fields
- For this reason, imblance between normal dose dataset and low dose dataset is severe
- Therefore we simulated low dose ct images from normal dose images for supervised learning
- The flow of simulating low dose ct images is displayed below
